3. ${includeAnswers ? 'Include an ANSWER KEY at the end in each question\'s "answer" field.' : 'Do NOT include answer fields.'}

NUMBERING RULES (VERY IMPORTANT):
- Do NOT include Roman numerals (I, II, III) in section titles — the app adds those automatically
- Do NOT include question numbers (1, 2, 3) in question text — the app adds those automatically
- Section titles should be just the name like "Meanings" not "I. Meanings"
- Question text should start directly with the question content, not "1. What is..."
- Example CORRECT section title: "Rhyming Words"
- Example WRONG section title: "II. Rhyming Words"
- Example CORRECT question: "The cat sat on the _________."
- Example WRONG question: "1. The cat sat on the _________."`;
